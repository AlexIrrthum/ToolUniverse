"""
Tool Name Utilities for ToolUniverse

This module provides utilities for automatically shortening tool names to fit
within length constraints (e.g., MCP's 64-character limit with server prefix).

The shortening algorithm intelligently truncates words while maintaining
readability and uniqueness.

    Intelligently shorten tool name by truncating words.

    The algorithm splits the tool name by underscores and applies intelligent
    truncation rules to each word while preserving the category prefix and
    maintaining readability.

    Strategy:
    - Split by underscores
    - Keep category (first word) intact
    - Truncate long words to 3-4 chars
    - Keep short words intact (≤3 chars)

    Args:
        name: Original tool name to shorten
        max_length: Maximum allowed length (default: 50 to account for MCP
            client prefixes like 'tooluniverse__' which is 14 chars, total 64)

        Shortened tool name that fits within max_length
